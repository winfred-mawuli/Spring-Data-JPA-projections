# Spring Data JPA Projections Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of Spring Data JPA projections in a Java application. It demonstrates how to use projections to fetch selective data from a database using Spring Data JPA.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 17 or higher
- Apache Maven
- Postgres or another supported database (configured in application.yml)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/winfred-mawuli/Spring-Data-JPA-projections.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd spring-data-jpa-projections
3. Build the project using Maven:
   mvn clean install
4. Run the application:
   mvn spring-boot:run

   ```bash


Access the application:

Once the application is running, you can access it at http://localhost:8080/todos.

Usage
The application exposes a REST API to perform CRUD operations on todo items. You can use tools like cURL, Postman, or a web browser to interact with the API endpoints.

Available Endpoints
POST /todos/: Create a new todo item. Send a JSON payload with the todo details.
GET /todos/: Retrieve all todo items.
Configuration
You can configure the database connection and other application properties in the src/main/resources/application.properties file.
